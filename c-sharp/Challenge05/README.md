# Challenge 05 - Singly Linked List
Create a linked list then create unit tests to make sure it's working as intended

## Challenge
- Create two classes   
    - Node with properties(value & pointer)
    - Linked Lists with methods(insert, includes, toString)
- Create unit tests
    - Can Instantiate
    - Can insert
    - Head = First Node
    - Will return true when finding a value
    - Will return false when searching for value
    - Can return a collection of values

## Approach & Efficiency
- created the scafolding
- created classes
- added methods & properties to classes
- created tests
