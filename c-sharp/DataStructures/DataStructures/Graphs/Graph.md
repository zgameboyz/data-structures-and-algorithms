# Challenge Summary
Create the GetNodes function that returns a list of verticies. I also included tests found in the DataStructureTests.



## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to create a method that takes in the graph and will extract all of the Verticies in the graph then display those in a list. This way I can see all of the Nodes in the graph.


## Solution
All you have to do is press the play button after using the repo it will run from program.cs and will display all of the nodes in the console.
